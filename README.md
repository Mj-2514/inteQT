## 🚀 Tech Stack (No fluff, just facts)

* **React** (with TypeScript)
* **Vite** (fast builds, zero nonsense)
* **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** (clean, consistent UI)
* **React Router** (client‑side routing)
* **Lucide Icons**
* **Vercel‑ready deployment**

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed before you even think of running the project:

* **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
* **npm** or **yarn**
* **Git**



---

## ⬇️ Clone the Repository

Straight to the point:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mj-2514/inteQT.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd inte-qt-reimagined
```

---

## 📥 Install Dependencies

Use **npm** (recommended):

```bash
npm install
```


---

## ▶️ Run the Project Locally

Fire it up:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will give you a local URL, usually:

```
http://localhost:8080
```
for backend
```
cd backend
```

```bash
npm i
node server.js
```

## 🧠 Philosophy

inteQt isn’t just a website.

It’s built to:

* Scale without collapsing
* Stay readable when complexity rises
* Look sharp without screaming for attention

Clean code. Clean design. No shortcuts.

---

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to make it yours?

* Update branding in `src/assets`
* Edit SEO data in the `Seo` component
* Add new pages inside `src/pages`
* Extend routes in `src/routes`

Everything is modular. Touch one thing, don’t break five.
